# Tony Robertson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

With MOD 1 I wanted to get comfortable with Ruby syntax how to use Ruby
efficiently. I also wanted to refresh OOP concepts.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual work is nice because I can focus on the language and using everything
I know. This sometimes lead me down a path of solving a problem like I would in
Javascript when there was a simple enumerable method to solve the same thing in
much less code. Overtime I think I have gotten a lot better at researching what
Ruby gives me.

#### Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tonyr729/sorting_cards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards/)

**Description:** In this project, we were tasked to write a program to simulate
a deck of cards. We were to add functionality to guess what the card on the top
of the deck is, and sort the deck.

**Evaluation Comments** N/A

**Evaluation Scores:**
  - **Functionality:** 3
  - **OOP:** 3
  - **Testing:** 3
  - **Version Control:** 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Both of the group projects gave me great opportunities and lessons to learn from.
With my paired project with Ricardo I learned if you assume someones skill
in coding, that can cause communication failures. With my paired project with Ali
and Michael it was a balance of being a mentor as well as contributing to the code
but not in a way that takes away from my partners learning.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RicardoL-AFati/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship/)

**Description:** In this project, we were tasked to write a program to simulate the game of battleship.

search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical
e-commerece business.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Community participation with my cohort: I check in with my fellow cohort as well
as offer my time for pairing to help people. I come in on the weekends exclusively
to offer help for those that need it.

Community participation with Turing: I've spoken to Jeff about interviewing him
for a pod cast. I've also written a medium article about paired programing and
the DTR process with Ricardo that we are trying to have featured on the Turing Publication.
